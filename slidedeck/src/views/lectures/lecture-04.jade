  section
    h1 Modules

  section
    p You can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app â€“ controllers, services, filters, directives, etc.

  section
    p Most applications have a main method that instantiates and wires together the different parts of the application.

  section
    p Angular apps don't have a main method. Instead modules declaratively specify how an application should be bootstrapped.

  section
    p There are several advantages to this approach:
    ul
      li The declarative process is easier to understand.
      li You can package code as reusable modules.
      li The modules can be loaded in any order because modules delay execution.

  section
    p The AngularJS team recommends you break up modules in the following way
    ul
      li A module for each feature
      li A module for each reusable component (especially directives and filters)
      li An application level module which depends on the above modules and contains any initialization code

  section
    p A module is a collection of configuration and run blocks which get applied to the application during the bootstrap process.

  section
    p In its simplest form the module consist of collection of two kinds of blocks.

  section
    h2 Configuration Blocks

  section
    p
      | Configuration blocks get executed during the provider registrations and configuration phase.
      | Only providers and constants can be injected into configuration blocks. This is to prevent accidental instantiation
      | of services before they have been fully configured.

  section
    p Angular provides convience methods for module configuration that are equivalent to the config block.

  section
    h2 Run Blocks

  section
    p
      | Run blocks get executed after the injector is created and are used to kickstart the application.
      | Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks. This is to prevent further system configuration
      | during application run time.

  section
    p Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method.

  section
    p A run block is the code which needs to run to kickstart the application.
    p It is executed after all of the service have been configured and the injector has been created.

  section
    p Example of run and config.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app', [])
        .config(function(injectables) {

        });
        .run(function(injectables) {

        });

  section
    h2 Dependencies

  section
    p Modules can list other modules as their dependencies.

  section
    p Depending on a module implies that required module needs to be loaded before the requiring module is loaded.

  section
    p Each module can only be loaded once, even if multiple other modules require it.

  section
    p Below is an example of how to specify a module dependency.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app', [
        'dependency1',
        'dependency2'
      ])
        .config(function() {
          //...
        });

      </code>

  section
    h1 Controllers

  section
    p In Angular, a controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope.

  section
    p You can create controllers on a module.  The first argument is the controller name, and the second is the constructor function.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('AppContrller', function($scope) {
          $scope.greeting = 'Hello World!';
        });

      </code>

  section
    p You should use controllers to
    ul
      li Set up the initial state of the $scope object.
      li Add behavior to the $scope object.

  section
    p You should not use controllers to
    ul
      li Manipulate DOM.
      li Share code or state across controllers.
      li Manage the life-cycle of other components
      li Format input
      li Format output

  section
    p In general, a controller shouldn't try to do too much.

  section
    p It should contain only the business logic needed for a single view.

  section
    p When creating a controller you can inject the new scope as well as other dependencies.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('AppContrller', fucntion($scope, myService) {

        });

      </code>

  section
    p You can associate Controllers with scope objects implicitly via the ngController directive.

  section
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-controller="AppController" &gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{employee.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
