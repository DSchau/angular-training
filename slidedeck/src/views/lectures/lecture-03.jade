  section
    p
      | JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which comes with great power of expression,
      | but it also comes with almost no help from the compiler.

  section
    p For this reason any code written in JavaScript needs to come with a strong set of tests.

  section
    p The Angular team has built many features into Angular which makes testing your applications easy.

  section
    h3 There is no excuse for not testing

  section
    p You'll more than likely spend half of your time in labs testing your solutions.

  section
    h1 Karma

  section
    p
      | Karma is essentially a tool which spawns a web server that executes source code against test
      | code for each of the browsers connected.

  section
    p
      | The results for each test against each browser are examined and displayed via the command line
      | to the developer such that they can see which browsers and tests passed or failed.

  section
    p We'll use Karma with Grunt to integrate tests directly into our development workflow.

  section
    h1 Jasmine

  section
    p Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

  section
    h2 Suites

  section
    p A test suite begins with a call to the global Jasmine function describe with two parameters: a string and a function.

  section
    p
      | The string is a name or title for a spec suite â€“ usually what is being tested and function is a block of code
      | that implements the suite.
